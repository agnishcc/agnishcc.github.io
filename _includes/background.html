      I'm currently an chatbot and blockchain freelancer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank">Upwork</a> bringing my client's idea to reality. I am also the lead developer and consultant at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.nyctravelbuddy.ai/" target="_blank">NYCTravelBuddy</a> building a travel companion chatbot for the masses. I am also pursuing my engineering degree from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.nit.ac.in/" target="_blank">Narula Institute Of Technology</a>.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between an idea and an actual product  &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a simplistic, beautiful &amp; an intelligent product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable, simple
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably binge-watching a netflix series, eating, 
      sleeping or playing around with dogs.
