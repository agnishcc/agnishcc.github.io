  description: A simple weather app I made at HubSpot's Fall 2016 Web App Workshop with Node.js, Express, and Heroku. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather and forecast data, and then used the current city's coordinates to create a map background that reflected the current city using the Google Maps API.
